# Overview

I developed a Simple Text Editor using C++ to enhance my skills as a software engineer and deepen my understanding of the language. This software allows users to open, edit, and save text files through a console-based interface. The project demonstrates core C++ features, including file handling, standard I/O operations, and container usage. If you want to run this program you should install Visual Studio (2022) and open the file that ends with ".sln" inside "SavedTextEditor" folder.

The purpose of writing this software was to practice implementing basic functionalities of a text editor, such as reading and writing files, editing content, and managing user inputs. Through this project, I aimed to solidify my understanding of C++ syntax and explore its standard library.

# Development Environment

- IDE: Visual Studio (2022)
- Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Operating System: Windows 10
- Git/GitHub

The programming language used for this project is C++. The standard library's iostream, fstream, vector, string, and sstream headers were utilized to handle input/output operations, file handling, and data storage.

# Future Work

For now everything is working as planned. Maybe in the future I will add some user interface.
